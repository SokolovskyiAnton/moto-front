      Before a return is sent, the customer needs written approval of the return from Lithium Customs. If a customer
      sends a return without written consent of Lithium Customs, a refund will not be issued and the customer will be
      responsible for the shipping fees incurred to get the item returned, or they will sacrifice the item.
    </p>
    <p class='mt-2'>
      Please give us a heads up after you send your return by emailing support@lithiumcustoms.com. To secure the return,
      please provide a tracking number.
    </p>
    <p class='mt-2'>
      If non-returnable items are returned without consent from our Customer Experience team, they will be returned back
      to the customer immediately. A restocking fee may be incurred on unauthorized returns.
    </p>

    <h4 class='text-2xl mt-3 font-semibold'>Return (If Applicable):</h4>

      Once your return is received and inspected, we will forward an email to notify you that we have received your
      returned item. Additionally, we will notify you of the approval or rejection of your refund. If the bike has no
      manufacturing defects, the wear and tear on the bike, shipping fee (both ways) and $100 restocking fee will be
      applied to Lithium Customs bike orders.

      card or original method of payment, within a specific timeframe.
