    <p class="mt-2">
      At Lithium Customs LLC (Lithium Customs), we take great care to make sure our products are higher quality, durability, speed and or range than our competitors. We’re confident that you and all your friends will be impressed as well, and we stand behind all of our products. Every bike we sell is covered by a limited warranty against Manufacturer Defects, subject to exclusions noted herein. This warranty is only valid in North America.
    </p>
    <h4 class="text-2xl mt-3 font-semibold">WARRANTY PERIOD</h4>
    <p class="mt-2">Subject to certain limitations, new products purchased directly from Lithium Customs (“Products”) are warranted to be free from defects in material and workmanship (“Manufacturer Defects”) for a period of one (1) year from the date of purchase or delivery date, whichever is later (“Warranty Period”).  Replacement parts used in warranty repairs will be warranted for the balance of the applicable Warranty Period.</p>
    <h4 class="text-2xl mt-3 font-semibold">NON TRANSFERABLE</h4>
    <p class="mt-2">This warranty is not transferable in any way and may not be exercised by anyone other than the original retail buyer (“Customer”) of the Products. Customers will be required to furnish the original receipt of purchase when filing a claim under this warranty.</p>
    <h4 class="text-2xl mt-3 font-semibold">WHAT’S COVERED</h4>
    <p class="mt-2">As part of our Satisfaction Guaranteed program, Lithium Customs will provide full replacement of any defective parts/components with free shipping within the first 30 days of purchase.  After 30 days, the Customer is responsible for all return shipment costs to our warehouse. This warranty applies only to Products, parts, and components assembled, and sold as new by Lithium Customs.  The following components are covered under this warranty against Manufacturer Defects:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc ml-5 mt-2">
      <li>Drive unit</li>
      <li>Frame</li>
      <li>Batteries</li>
      <li>Mechanical components</li>
      <li>Electrical components</li>
    </ul>
    <h4 class="text-2xl mt-3 font-semibold">SHIPPING DAMAGE CLAIMS</h4>
    <p class="mt-2">Upon receipt, the Customer should immediately inspect Products for damage.  Freight damage claims can be extremely time sensitive, and therefore, Lithium Customs will not accept freight damage claims later than 7 days from Customer’s receipt of the Product.  The Customer should note any damage to the Products on the Bill of Lading before the shipment is accepted.  The Customer should also document any damage with photographs, and date the images whenever possible. Furthermore, the Customer should keep all packaging and paperwork until the inspection process is complete.

      Damage claims must be reported to Lithium Customs within 7 days of delivery.  Please contact the Customer Support team for return/replacement instructions by submitting an email claim to support@lithiumcustoms.com.
    </p>
    <h4 class="text-2xl mt-3 font-semibold">WHAT’S NOT COVERED</h4>
    <p class="mt-2">This warranty does not cover normal wear and tear of the Products.  Furthermore, this warranty will not cover any damage resulting from the abuse or neglect of the Products.  Examples of abuse and neglect include, but are not limited to:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc ml-5 mt-2">
      <li>Damage as a result of accidents, collisions, road hazards, or operation on surfaces, such as stairs, not intended for conventional e-bike use; damage from external factors such as salt air or saltwater, bird droppings, or chemicals.</li>
      <li>Racing or competition use, modification of original parts, abnormal strain.</li>
      <li>Water damage.</li>
      <li>Use of lubricants that are not suitable for e-bike use.</li>
      <li>Commercial applications, such as transporting cargo, delivering newspapers, and rentals.</li>
      <li>Lack of proper maintenance, installation of parts or accessories that are not equivalent in design and quality to genuine Lithium Customs parts (“Incompatible Parts”).</li>
      <li>Temporary decrease in power or distance that can be traveled on a single battery charge, as described in the Owner’s Manual, due to operating conditions such as ambient temperatures, load, inclines, frequent starting and stopping, and normal system-protection functions, as well as temperature-related performance of the battery charger.</li>
      <li>Normal deterioration, including the gradual decrease of battery capacity over the warranty period as long as the battery capacity is still 50% or more of the initial capacity before the warranty expiration and the total number of battery charging cycles is 200 or less. Other normal deterioration includes natural fading of painted or plated surfaces, and cosmetic ozone or weather cracking in tires.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="mt-2">Any non-warranty work done concurrently with a warranty repair/replacement will be subject to ordinary parts/labor fees.</p>
